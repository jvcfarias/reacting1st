<h1> My first react application </h1>

Hey recruiter :wave:! 

My name is Jo√£o, I have been paving my way into becoming a fullstack dev, this is my first <strong>react project.</strong> :happy: 

It is part of a bootcamp I've been working on, so I'd like to point you out special attention to the <strong> components</strong> inside the <strong>src</strong> folder.

<h2> Special attention to the components </h2>

<ul> Button </ul> 

<ul> Card </ul>

<ul> Item </ul>
